ChImgPro

Using htm5 to build a image process app

ChImgPro is short as Chao's Image Processing Library
Chao's my Chinese name, and this app is due to help people process local or remote images as a whole, cross-platform.
But which is also my scar, is that this app can only runs on HTML5 CANVAS element supporting browsers. If you have any
interests in it, you are meant to build a localhost server and put all resources and scripts into the www_root folder, 
it could be other names varied with different OS.
For Linux, there's nothing to change, but sometimes Firefox need to disable some security strategies to ensure the App's
fully running.
Thanks,
